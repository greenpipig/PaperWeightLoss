For 20 years, denial of service attacks have been part of the criminal toolbox and will only become more widespread and powerful. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are attacks that attempt to make services undeliverable. This can be done by blocking access to almost any facility: servers, devices, services, networks, applications, and even specific transactions in applications.
In DOS attacks, it is a system that sends malicious data or requests; DDoS attacks come from multiple systems. In general, these attacks work by sending a large number of data requests to the system. This may be through sending a large number of requests to the web server to attack the page, causing the page to crash under the request; it may also be sending a large number of queries to the database, the result is that the available Internet bandwidth, CPU and ram capacity become overburdened, the impact may only be as small as the service interruption, and the scale of the whole website, application and even the whole offline business.
DDoS attacks look like a lot of non malicious things, which may cause usability problems, such as server or system downtime, too many legitimate requests from legitimate users, or even cable disconnection. It usually requires traffic analysis to determine what happened.
The incident permanently changed how denial of service attacks were viewed: in early 2000, Canadian high school student Michael calce launched an attack on Yahoo. Through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, he successfully shut down a leading web engine at that time. Over the next week, calce targeted and successfully destroyed Amazon, CNN, eBay and other websites. Of course, this is not the first DDoS attack, but this series of highly open and successful attacks has transformed denial of service attacks from novel and small troubles to permanent business saboteurs in the eyes of CISO and CIO.
Since then, DDoS attacks have become a very common threat, because they are often used to retaliate, extort, as a means of online activities, and even launch cyber warfare. Over the years, DDoS attacks have also become more threatening. In the mid-1990s, an attack could involve sending 150 requests per second - enough to destroy many systems. Now they can exceed 1000 Gbps, and the huge scale of botnets has largely driven this trend.
In October 2016, Internet infrastructure service provider dyn DNS (now Oracle dyn) was plagued by a wave of DNS queries for tens of millions of IP addresses. Attacks via Mirai botnet have reportedly infected more than 100000 IOT devices, including IP cameras and printers. At its peak, the number of milai robots reached 400000. Services such as Amazon, Netflix, reddit, spotify, Tumblr and twitter have all been disrupted.
At the beginning of 2018, a new DDoS technology began to appear. On February 28, the version control of GitHub, a hosted service, suffered a massive denial of service attack, with 1.35 TB per second of traffic attacking the popular website. Although GitHub was only off-line intermittently and successfully repelled the attack in less than 20 minutes, the scale of the attack was worrying because it exceeded dyn attack, which peaked at 1.2 TB per second.
The analysis of attack technology shows that in some aspects, it is simpler than other attacks. Although dyn attack is the product of Mirai Botnet, it needs malware to infect thousands of IOT devices, but GitHub attack uses the server running memcached memory cache system, which can return very large data blocks.
Memcached is only used on protected servers running on the internal network. There is usually no security mechanism to prevent malicious attackers from spoofing IP addresses and sending large amounts of data to unsuspecting victims. Unfortunately, tens of thousands of memcached servers are on the open Internet, and their use in DDoS attacks is also surging. It's unfair to say that servers are "hijacked" because they are happy to send packets without asking any questions.
A few days after the GitHub attack, another memcached based DDoS attack attacked a US service provider with 1.7tb per second of data.
The importance of Mirai botnet is that, unlike most DDoS attacks, it uses vulnerable IOT devices rather than PCs and servers. According to bi intelligence, by 2020, it is believed that there will be 34 billion connected devices, most of which (24 billion) are Internet of things devices, which is particularly scary.
Unfortunately, Mirai will not be the last botnet to use the Internet of things. A survey of the security teams at Akamai, cloudflare, Flashpoint, Google, risk and Cymru found that a similar scale botnet called WireX consists of 100000 Android devices in 100 countries. A series of large-scale DDoS attacks against content providers and content delivery networks have triggered investigations
